# stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens

This project is intended to help users identify cases where tokens, functions and mixins defined as part of various projects relating to the Carbon Design System are used. [www.carbondesignsystem.com]

It consists of a stylelint plugin and depends on various Carbon Design System packages for loading settings.

It includes, but may not be limited to, linting for @carbon/themes, @carbon/colors, @carbon/layout, @carbon/type and @carbon/motion.

Not incluced, as they're not used through SCSS, are Carbon Icons, Grid and any other DOM related checks..

## Please be helpful

Before we start this project is a work in progress which deliberately outputs warnings when it comes accross a syntax that has not yet been catered for. If you see one of these warnings please raise an issue so that it can be addressed.

## Stylelint

Before you can use this stylelint plugin you will need to install and configure stylelint.

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint for details

NOTE: Just in case you were wondering, yes you can use comments to enable and disable the linter.
E.g. // stylelint-disable-next-line

## Installation

```bash
npm install stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens
```

```bash
yarn add stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens
```

## Usage

Add it to your stylelint config `plugins` array.

```js
module.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  // ...
  plugins: ["stylelint-plugin-carbon-tokens"],
  //...
};
```

Then add rules as follows:

```js
modules.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  //...
  rules: {
    //... other rules
    "carbon/layout-token-use": true,
    "carbon/motion-token-use": [true, { severity: "warning" }],
    "carbon/theme-token-use": true,
    "carbon/type-token-use": true,
    //...other rules
  },
  //...
};
```

NOTE: Motion is shown above with a standard stylelint secondary option `severity` set to `warning` the default is `error`.

## Variables

SCSS `$variables` and CSS `--variable` declared before are checked.

## Secondary Options

Each of the rules listed above have secondary options which are documented in the individual rule README.md files along with defaults..

- [Layout token use](./src/rules/layout-token-use/README.md)
- [Motion token use](./src/rules/motion-token-use/README.md)
- [Theme token use](./src/rules/theme-token-use/README.md)
- [Type token use](./src/rules/type-token-use/README.md)

The simplest type of secondary options are boolean and of the form `acceptSomeThing: Boolean`

e.g.

```js
modules.exports = {
  // stylelint.js
  //...
  rules: {
    //... other rules
    "carbon/type-token-use": [
      true,
      {
        severity: "warning",
        acceptUndefinedVariables: true,
        acceptCarbonTypeScaleFunction: false,
      },
    ],
    //...other rules
  },
  //...
};
```

NOTE: By default rules accept SCSS and CSS variables not defined in the current file prior to their use. Set acceptUndefinedVariables to false to disable this behaviour.

## Advanced options

These options when omitted to accept the defaults. They are intended to support non-standard use cases and accept values that use a syntax which may well need some refining as the project moves forward.

- includeProps: Array
- acceptValues: Array

Arrays of strings and/or Regex followed by a range in angled brackets.

The defaults for these are defined in the individual README files listed above.

- `includeProps: []` - Indicates default, same as omitting the property
- `includeProps: ["*"]` - Indicates default, same as omitting the property
- `includeProps: ["/^\\$my-color--/", "*"]` - SCSS variable starting "\$my-color--", plus default values specified

The last option here shows how you could elect to check your own tokens refer to values acceptable to the linter.

- `acceptValues: ["$/^\\$my-color--/"]` - Accept SCSS variables starting "\$my-color--"

### includeProps Range

Can innclude a range value expressed inside greater than and less than signs.

e.g. `["/prop-a$/<-1>", "/prop-b$/<1 -2>"]`

The above specifies the last value of `prop-a` and the first to second last of `prop-b`,

It can be applied either to regex or string values and allows values or a range of values to be selected from a multipart value.

The range value allows values to be selected from a multipart value such as a box-shadow.

- Positive values represent positions at the start of a value list e.g. 1 is the first value.
- Negative values represent positions at the end of a value list. e.g. -1 = last value

- If no range is specified the whole value list is checked.
- A single value means only that value in a list is checked
- Two values represent start and end values of a range in the list.

### includeProps specific values

For some props e.g. transform we are only intereste in values that match a certain criteria.

This is specified as part of the includedProp inside [].

e.g. `translate[/^transform/]`

In this case only values starting `transform` are tested so not `skew` for example. As per the prop definition the can be a plain string or regular expression.

### Function values specific range for function parameters

If not specified then parameters are treated as a single value.

The range for parameters is specified in ()

e.g. `calc(1)` or `translate(1,2)`.

NOTE: this is not currently a user configurable option.
